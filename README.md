# Spatial Indexing

## PR Quad Tree and MX-CIF Quad Tree

You can find usage details of interfaces available for Spatial Data Indexing in this document.
There are two indexes constructed that extend SpatialIndexInterface. - 

* PointSpatialIndex
	* Uses Point Region Quadtree to index data from the Point table
* RectangleSpatialIndex 
	* Uses MX-CIF Quadtree to index data from the Rectangle table.

## Notes:

### Rectangles Intersect Logic

* According to the present scenario, if 2 rectangles touch each other then we should return it as part of the search operation. 
	* But in this case we will have to check all the rectangles that touch a given rectangle. This operation consumes a lot of time as in some cases we may have to check all the rectangles.
	* We are still working on efficiently solving this problem and in the process we may have to have multiple discussions with the class and the professor.

* As of now our spatial indexing for rectangle returns only those rectangles if it is completely inside the given rectangle.
	* Our implementation of spatial indexing for rectangles work for majority of the test cases, however output of few test cases are not as expected. 
	* We are working on these test cases and we will be pushing the changes shortly.

## Function Definition

### PointSpatialIndex contains the following functions:

`PointCollection search(Rectangle bounds)`

>Search the query rectangle provided and return all points satisfying the query

>>Input Paramaters
>>>bounds - Diagonal Coordinates of the query rectangle. Assumes that the getCoordinates function returns (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) in order

>> Returns
>>> PointCollection - Collection of points satisfying the query


---		

`RectangleCollection searchRectangle(Rectangle)`
>This method is not implemented for the class. Throws an exception containing String message if invoked.

---	

`void createIndex(PointCollection points,float width, float height)`

>Creates Point Spatial Data Index for the given set of points

>>Input Paramters
>>>points - Collection of points to be indexed
>>>width, height - of the bounding box containing all the points. Assumes that the origin (0,0) is the centre of the bounding box with quadrant dimension width/2 * height/2

>>Returns
>>>void

---	

`void createIndex(RectangleCollection, float, float)`
>This method is not implemented for the class. Throws an exception containing String message if invoked.

---	

`bool update(PointCollection points,float width, float height)`

>Updates the Point Spatial Data index created. This method deletes existing index structure and constructs it for given set of points

>>Input Paramters
>>>points - Collection of points to be indexed
>>>width, height - of the bounding box containing all the points. Assumes that the origin (0,0) is the centre of the bounding box with quadrant dimension width/2 * height/2

>>Returns
>>>bool - sucess status of the update operation

---	
	
`bool update(RectangleCollection,float, float)`
>This method is not implemented for the class. Throws an exception containing String message if invoked.

---	

`bool deleteIndex()`

>Deletes index structure for Point Spatial data

>>Returns
>>>bool - success status of the delete operation

---		
### RectangleSpatialIndex contains the following functions:
	
`PointCollection search(Rectangle)`
>This method is not implemented for the class. Throws an exception containing String message if invoked.

---

>>Input Paramters
>>>bounds - Diagonal Coordinates of the query rectangle. Assumes that the getCoordinates function returns (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) in order

>>Returns
>>>RectangleCollection - Collection of rectangles satisfying the query

---
		
`void createIndex(PointCollection, float, float)`
